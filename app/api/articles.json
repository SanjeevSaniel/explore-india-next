        "description": "The early signs of AMOS threats were reported in March and April. In September, the security researchers at Malwarebytes discovered that Mac users were tricked into installing AMOS via fake Google Search Ads. Now, Malwarebytes reports that AMOS is injected into Macs using compromised websites to deliver fake Safari and Chrome updates. This fake browser update chain is labeled as “ClearFake”, and was previously seen against Windows as well. Let’s see how to spot fake updates and avoid the AMOS threat on Macs. First spotted in early 2023, a potent malware called Atomic macOS Stealer (AMOS) has become a growing threat. It’s a powerful piece of malware that targets Apple users and tricks them into installing the software on their machines. Once installed, it can steal iCloud Keychain passwords, credit card information, files, and more. And now, in the latest iteration, AMOS is being delivered to Mac users via fake Safari and Chrome updates.",
